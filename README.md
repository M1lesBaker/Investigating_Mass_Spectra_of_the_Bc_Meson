# Investigating Mass Spectra of the Bc Meson

## Abstract
This program uses the work of Erwin Schrödinger to investigate the mass of the BC meson’s bound states. It involves
numerically solving the Schrödinger equation using the bisection algorithm. The mass of Bc (2S) state was found to
be 6.79 ± 0.09 GeV which is consistent with several literature values including that measured by the Particle Data
Group. In addition, multiple other mass states are also predicted using the potential model found. The report explores
the errors involved with these calculations and makes suggestions for improvement of the method.

## Scientic Summary for a General Audience
In the macroscopic world we can measure the force, distance and speed between two objects with ease. When we move to
the scale of atoms this is not possible anymore and so we must use the theory of quantum mechanics which describes how
particles move and behave at the atomic scale. One of the particles at the atomic scale is the meson, it is made of two even
smaller particles called quarks. The quarks are held together by an invisible force called the strong force which is similar
to the electromagnetic force but is much stronger and acts only over an atomic distance.
Using an equation called the Schrödinger equation, quantum mechanics describes the likelihood of where a particle may
be found at any time. In this program we solve the Schrödinger equation for a meson called the BC meson, which is made
of two types of quarks called the bottom and charm quarks. The strong force holds the quarks at certain separations from
each other known as bound states. We make use of the calculation power of the computer and a special iteration technique
known as the bisection algorithm to solve these states and the energies that hold them together.

## Program Code
You may notice that this GitHub repository doesn't currently contain any code. This is because I made the program on a Jupyter Notebook hosted by Durham University which I no longer have access to. I have requested access and in the near future the code will appear here so please check back later.
